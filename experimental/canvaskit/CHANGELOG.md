## [Unreleased]
### Added
 - `SkFont` now exposed.
 - `MakeCanvasSurface` can now take a canvas element directly.
 - `MakeWebGLCanvasSurface` can now take a WebGL context as an integer and use it directly.

### Removed

## [0.3.0] - 2018-12-18

### Added
- Add Canvas2D JS layer. This mirrors the HTML Canvas API. This may be omitted at compile time
    it by adding `no_canvas` to the `compile.sh` invocation.
- `CanvasKit.FontMgr.DefaultRef()` and `fontmgr.MakeTypefaceFromData` to load fonts.
- Exposed `SkPath.setVolatile`. Some animations see performance improvements by setting
their paths' volatility to true.

### Fixed
- `SkPath.addRect` now correctly draws counter-clockwise vs clockwise.

### Changed
- `CanvasKit.MakeImageShader` no longer takes encoded bytes, but an `SkImage`, created from
    `CanvasKit.MakeImageFromEncoded`. Additionally, the optional parameters `clampIfUnpremul`
    and `localMatrix` have been exposed.
- `SkPath.arcTo` now takes `startAngle`, `sweepAngle`, `forceMoveTo` as additional parameters.
- `SkPath.stroke` has a new option `precision`  It defaults to 1.0.
- CanvasKit comes with one font (NotoMono) instead of the Skia TestTypeface. Clients are encouraged
  to use the new `fontmgr.MakeTypefaceFromData` for more font variety.

### Removed
- `CanvasKit.initFonts()` - no longer needed.
