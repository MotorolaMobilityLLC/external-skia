# Failures of any GM tests/configs listed in this file will be ignored [1], as
# if they had been marked "ignore-failure": true in the per-builder
# expected-results.json files.
#
# The idea is that, if you modify a GM test in such a way that you know it will
# require rebaselines on multiple platforms, you should add that test's name to
# this list within the same CL that modifies the test.
# Then, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, you should rebaseline the tests (they will show up
# as status "failure-ignored") and remove the line you added to this file.
# If there are any lingering failures that need to be suppressed (ignored), you
# MUST move those suppressions into the per-builder expected-results.json files.
#
# Any lines starting with '#' are comments and will be ignored.
# Other than that, each line must either be whitespace or list just one test.
#
# For more information, see https://code.google.com/p/skia/issues/detail?id=1600
# ('GM expectations: create tool to suppress failures until new baselines are
# checked in')
#
#
# [1] Differences between renderModes (e.g., normal rendering path and
# "serialized") are NEVER ignored.  See
# https://code.google.com/p/skia/issues/detail?id=1748 ('gm: add new result
# type, RenderModeMismatch')
