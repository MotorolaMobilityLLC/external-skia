 *      - it can only be backed by raster or gpu (no generators)
 *      - it can be backed by a GrTexture larger than its nominal bounds
 *      - it can't be drawn tiled
 *      - it can't be drawn with MIPMAPs
 * It is similar to SkImage in that it abstracts how the pixels are stored/represented.
 *
 * Note: the contents of the backing storage outside of the subset rect are undefined.
