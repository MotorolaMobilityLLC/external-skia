// SkRecord (REC-ord) represents a sequence of SkCanvas calls, saved for future use.
// These future uses may include: replay, optimization, serialization, or combinations of those.
//
// Though an enterprising user may find calling alloc(), append(), visit(), and mutate() enough to
// work with SkRecord, you probably want to look at SkRecorder which presents an SkCanvas interface
// for creating an SkRecord, and SkRecordDraw which plays an SkRecord back into another SkCanvas.
//
// SkRecord often looks like it's compatible with any type T, but really it's compatible with any
// type T which has a static const SkRecords::Type kType.  That is to say, SkRecord is compatible
// only with SkRecords::* structs defined in SkRecords.h.  Your compiler will helpfully yell if you

    // Implementation notes!
    //
    // Logically an SkRecord is structured as an array of pointers into a big chunk of memory where
    // records representing each canvas draw call are stored:
    //
    // fRecords:  [*][*][*]...
    //             |  |  |
    //             |  |  |
    //             |  |  +---------------------------------------+
    //             |  +-----------------+                        |
    //             |                    |                        |
    //             v                    v                        v
    //   fAlloc:  [SkRecords::DrawRect][SkRecords::DrawPosTextH][SkRecords::DrawRect]...
    //
    // In the scheme above, the pointers in fRecords are void*: they have no type.  The type is not
    // stored in fAlloc either; we just write raw data there.  But we need that type information.
    // Here are some options:
    //   1) use inheritance, virtuals, and vtables to make the fRecords pointers smarter
    //   2) store the type data manually in fAlloc at the start of each record
    //   3) store the type data manually somewhere with fRecords
    //
    // This code uses approach 3).  The implementation feels very similar to 1), but it's
    // devirtualized instead of using the language's polymorphism mechanisms.  This lets us work
    // with the types themselves (as SkRecords::Type), a sort of limited free RTTI; it lets us pay
    // only 1 byte to store the type instead of a full pointer (4-8 bytes); and it leads to better
    // decoupling between the SkRecords::* record types and the operations performed on them in
    // visit() or mutate().  The recorded canvas calls don't have to have any idea about the
    // operations performed on them.
    //
    // We store the types in a parallel fTypes array, mainly so that they can be tightly packed as
    // single bytes.  This has the side effect of allowing very fast analysis passes over an
    // SkRecord looking for just patterns of draw commands (or using this as a quick reject
    // mechanism) though there's admittedly not a very good API exposed publically for this.
    //
    // We pull one final sneaky trick in the implementation.  When recording canvas calls that need
    // to store less than a pointer of data, we don't go through the usual path of allocating the
    // draw command in fAlloc and a pointer to it in fRecords; instead, we ignore fAlloc and
    // directly allocate the object in the space we would have put the pointer in fRecords.  This is
    // why you'll see uintptr_t instead of void* in Record below.
    //
    // The cost of appending a single record into this structure is then:
    //   - 1 + sizeof(void*) + sizeof(T) if sizeof(T) >  sizeof(void*)
    //   - 1 + sizeof(void*)             if sizeof(T) <= sizeof(void*)
